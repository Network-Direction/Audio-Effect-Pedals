# Converting Analogue Signals to Digital Signals

Generally when we look at audio signals, we are looking at analogue signals. A sine wave for example, is analogue. Many effects circuits we make work with these waves directly, making them analogue circuits.

However, some circuits we use are digital. For example, we might want to use a microcontroller (such as the one on an Arduino) so we can read a frequency and analyse it, modify it, or something else. In a case like this, we need a digital signal.

## Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC)
An ADC does exactly what the name implies. It takes an analogue signal and converts it to a digital one. How are these signals different?

Instead of using a continuous range of voltage to describe a wave, a digital signal uses fixed voltage points. For example, a square wave could be used as a digital signal
