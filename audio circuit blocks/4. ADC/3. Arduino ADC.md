# Arduino ADC

The arduino can be very useful in effects pedals (and electronics in general), as it can take an analogue signal, and tell you something about it, or apply some effect digitally.

Of course, the key part of this we need is its ADC, as it will only work with digital signals.

## Ardunio ADC

The Arduino Uno has six onboard ADC channels. These are the analogue inputs A0 - A5.

These channels expect an input between 0v and +5v. This can be changed using the **analogReference()** function, but the options here are limited.

Each channel has a 10-bit resolution, meaning that input voltages are represented as values from 0 to 1023 (where 0v is 0, and 5v is 1023). The **analogRead()** function reads the voltage on the analog pin, and returns a value from 0 - 1023.

## Interrupts

Normally, Arduino code runs within the main **loop()**. For many things this is fine, but for audio applications it causes a problem. The code within the loop affects how long each loop takes to run. This makes it difficult to perform tasks on very regular intervals. We need regular intervals, for example, when sampling an input signal.

Fortunately, the arduino, like many microcontrollers and computers, contain _interrupts_. To oversimplify a bit, a interrupt is a signal sent to the microcontroller to tell it to run a specific block of code, regardless of where it's up to in the main loop.

Effectively, it _interrupts_ the loop execution to run some critical code, and then allows the loop to continue where it left off.

Broadly speaking, we might use interrupts in two possible ways:
* To handle a critical event as soon as it happens
* To run some code on a regular interval

As you can see, for audio signals, interrupts are critical for sampling.
