# Analogue and Digital Signals

Generally when we look at audio signals, we are looking at analogue signals. A sine wave for example, is analogue. Many effects circuits we make work with these waves directly, making them analogue circuits.

However, some circuits we use are digital. For example, we might want to use a microcontroller (such as the one on an Arduino) so we can read a frequency and analyse it, modify it, or something else. In a case like this, we need a digital signal.

This is true for many other circuits too, not just audio. It's quite common whenever sensors are involved.

## Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC)
An ADC does exactly what the name implies. It takes an analogue signal and converts it to a digital one. How are these signals different?

Instead of using a continuous range of voltage to describe a wave, a digital signal uses fixed voltage points. For example, a square wave could be used as a digital signal, where 0v could represent one value, and +5v could represent another value.

This could be achieved with a simple opamp circuit, or with a **comparitor**, where a sine wave (analogue) signal is the input, and a square wave (digitial) signal is the output.

This very simple ADC would be a **one-bit ADC**. There are two possible values, 0v and 5v, which can be represented with a single binary number, 0 and 1.

The Arduino Nano includes five independant 10-bit ADCs. A 10-bit ADC uses 10 binary numbers to represent a signal. That is, it will expect an analogue signal that ranges from 0v to 5v. The voltage will be represented as a number from 0 to 1023 (10 bits means 1024 numbers). Examples are:
* 0 - 0v
* 512 - 2.5v
* 1023 - 5v
