# Anti Aliasing

**Anti Aliasing** is a term that comes up in many different fields, including audio. Really, it's important to any type of signal processing, whether audio, video, or something else.


</br></br>
## What is Aliasing?

Aliasing is a side effect that we sometimes get when processing a digital signal.

Have you ever watched TV and seen a helicopter's rotor blades spinning, but it almost looks like they are staying still? Or a car's wheels that look like they're still or maybe even spinning backward slowly? These are examples of aliasing.

Aliasing occurs when a signal is being sampled at a rate at which we can't observe oscillation.

For example, think of a video camera filming a spinning wheel. The video camera will record a number of pictures each second. This is the sample rate. Now imagine that the wheel is turning at a speed so it has turned one full revolution every time the video camera captures an image. The result is, we don't get to see the wheel turn, so it appears to be still.

Now imagine that we're capturing a simple audio signal. If the wave's frequency is the same as the sample rate, what will happen? The wave will not appear to be oscillating. Once converted to digital, each sample will be the same value, and we won't have captured anything useful about that signal.

</br></br>
In some cases this isn't a big deal. Who cares if a wheel looks like it's spinning when you're watching a car chase in some action movie?

In other cases, like in audio applications, this can have a far bigger effect. So how can we work around this?

## Nyquist Theorem

The **Nyquist Theorem** says that to reconstruct an analogue signal digitally, it needs to be sampled at least twice as fast as the highest frequency in the signal. Remember that a sound has a _fundamental frequency_ and additional _harmonic_ and _non-harmonic_ content? (If not, look at the audio theory section).

The Nyquist theorem is telling us that we need to find the highest frequency in a signal, and double that to find the minimum sampling rate. Conversely, the **Nyquist Frequency** is the highest frequency that can be accurately represented at a given sampling rate. As you can probably see, this is _half_ the sampling rate.

## Anti Aliasing

So given this information, the way to prevent aliasing is to make sure the sampling rate is always at least twice the frequency of the input signal. That's why it's common to record audio at around 48KHz sampling rate. The frequencies we hear go up to about 20KHz, so we double that to 40KHz, and add a bit more just to be sure.

But you might also realise that we don't always need all frequencies in a signal. Imagine we're building a digital circuit to check if an instrument is in tune. Just for illustration sake, let's say we want to listen to the A4 key on a piano, and confirm that it is 440Hz as expected.

When we press the key, we don't just get a 440Hz signal. We also get harmonics such as 880Hz, and others, as well as non-harmonic frequencies. We could find the highest frequency and make sure the ADC in our circuit samples at a minimum of twice that value.

In this example, there's an easier way. As we really only care about the _fundamental_ frequency, the one that's expected to be around 440Hz, we can ignore all the harmonics. We could build a filter that filters out all the frequencies higher than 500Hz or so, and then we only need to sample at 1KHz (or a little over).

In this over-simplified example, the sampling rate would be 1KHz, and the nyquist frequency is 500Hz.

## Anti Aliasing Filter

An anti aliasing filter is a Low Pass Filter (LPF) that allows frequencies below the nyquist frequency through, while attenuating higher frequencies.

These are typically a second-order active filter. In some cases they may be 3rd or 4th order, or even use a passive filter followed by an active filter.

Here is a simple example of an anti-aliasing filter (from https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2020-anti-aliasing-filter-design-and-applications-in-sampling):

This is a non-inverting example, but inverting would be fine too.

This is also a unity-gain design, meaning there will be no gain in the signal when it leaves the opamp. Putting a resistor in the feedback path is also an option to create an amplifier and filter all in one.
