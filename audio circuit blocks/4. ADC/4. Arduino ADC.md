# Arduino ADC

The arduino can be very useful in effects pedals (and electronics in general), as it can take an analogue signal, and tell you something about it, or apply some effect digitally.

Of course, the key part of this we need is its ADC, as it will only work with digital signals.

## Ardunio ADC

The Arduino Uno has six onboard ADC channels. These are the analogue inputs A0 - A5.

These channels expect an input between 0v and +5v. This can be changed using the **analogReference()** function, but the options here are limited.

Each channel has a 10-bit resolution, meaning that input voltages are represented as values from 0 to 1023 (where 0v is 0, and 5v is 1023). The **analogRead()** function reads the voltage on the analog pin, and returns a value from 0 - 1023.

## ADC Registers

The Arduino uses several registers to communicate with the ADC manually through interrupts. For signal processing that requires a regular sample rate, this is better then using arduino functions in the normal **loop()**.

| Register | Description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ADMUX    | ADC Multiplexer Selection Register |
| ADCSRA   | ADC Control and Status Register A  |
| ADCSRB   | ADC Control and Status Register B  |
