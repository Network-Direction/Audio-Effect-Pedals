# Arduino ADC

The arduino can be very useful in effects pedals (and electronics in general), as it can take an analogue signal, and tell you something about it, or apply some effect digitally.

Of course, the key part of this we need is its ADC, as it will only work with digital signals.


</br></br>
## Ardunio ADC

The Arduino Uno has six onboard ADC channels. These are the analogue inputs A0 - A5.

These channels expect an input between 0v and +5v. This can be changed using the **analogReference()** function, but the options here are limited.

Each channel has a 10-bit resolution, meaning that input voltages are represented as values from 0 to 1023 (where 0v is 0, and 5v is 1023). The **analogRead()** function reads the voltage on the analog pin, and returns a value from 0 - 1023.


</br></br>
## ADC Registers

The Arduino uses several registers to communicate with the ADC manually through interrupts. For signal processing that requires a regular sample rate, this is better then using arduino functions in the normal **loop()**.

| Register | Description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ADMUX    | ADC Multiplexer Selection Register |
| ADCL     | ADC Data Register                  |
| ADCH     | ADC Data Register                  |
| ADCSRA   | ADC Control and Status Register A  |
| ADCSRB   | ADC Control and Status Register B  |

### Data Registers

The result of an ADC conversion is stored in the ADC data registers. There are two 8-bit registers, which combined make 16-bits of register storage (it needs 10-bits for ADC results).

The 'L' and 'H' refer to the 'low' and 'high' bits of the result.

We can configure the ADC to store the result in _left aligned_ or _right aligned_ format.


</br></br>
### Multiplexer

This is an 8-bit register, used to set the voltage reference, the format of the data, and the input channel.

| Bit | Name     | Description        |
| --- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 7   | REFS1    | Voltage reference  |
| 6   | REFS0    | Voltage reference  |
| 5   | ADLAR    | Left adjust result |
| 4   | _Unused_ |                    |
| 3   | MUX3     | Input select       |
| 2   | MUX2     | Input select       |
| 1   | MUX1     | Input select       |
| 0   | MUX0     | Input select       |


</br></br>
#### Voltage Reference
The arduino needs a reference voltage to know how to interpret the input signal. We can either use an internal reference, or supply our own reference to the AREF pin.

In general, we would want to use 5v as the voltage reference, which the Uno and Nano can do internally. That means the input wave amplitude can be from 0v to 5v. If we wanted to use some other reference, we could apply that voltage to the AREF pin.

Note, if we use an internal voltage we should place a capacitor between AREF and ground, to minimise ripple or transient noise. A 100nF capacitor should be fine. Note, it will work without a capacitor, but the capacitor is best practice.

| REFS1 | REFS0 | Reference Voltage            |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 0     | 0     | External voltage on AREF pin |
| 0     | 1     | Use AVCC (internal voltage)  |
| 1     | 0     | _Reserved_                   |
| 1     | 1     | Internal 1.1v                |


</br></br>
#### Left Adjust

The ADC conversion result (10-bits) is stored in the **ADC Data Register** (ADCH). This is really two 8-bit registers that store part of the result each. We can think of it as a 16-bit register though, with bits 0 to 15.

By default (when **ADLAR** is zero), The 10 bit result is _right aligned_ in the register. That is, bit 0 of the result is stored in bit 0 of the register, and so on.

When **ADLAR** is set to 1, the result is _right aligned_ in the register. Bit 0 of the result is in bit 6 of the register, carrying on to bit 10 of the result in bit 15 of the register.


</br></br>
#### Input Select

The **MUX0** to **MUX3** bits manually select the input ADC.

| MUX0 | MUX1 | MUX2 | MUX3 | ADC Number |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | ADC0 (A0)  |
| 0    | 0    | 0    | 1    | ADC1 (A1)  |
| 0    | 0    | 1    | 0    | ADC2 (A2)  |
| 0    | 0    | 1    | 1    | ADC3 (A3)  |
| 0    | 1    | 0    | 0    | ADC4 (A4)  |
| 0    | 1    | 0    | 1    | ADC5 (A5)  |

</br></br>
More values can be used on some boards, which support more ADC inputs.


</br></br>
### Control and Status Register

This is made of two 8-bit registers, **ADCSRA** and **ADCSRB**. These are for general configuration of the ADC.

**ADCSRA:**

| Bit | Name  | Description          |
| --- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 7   | ADEN  | Enable the ADC       |
| 6   | ADSC  | Start ADC conversion |
| 5   | ADATE | Auto trigger enable  |
| 4   | ADIF  | ADC interrupt flag   |
| 3   | ADIE  | ADC interrupt enable |
| 2   | ADPS2 | Prescaler select     |
| 1   | ADPS1 | Prescaler select     |
| 0   | ADPS0 | Prescaler select     |


</br></br>
**ADCSRB:**

| Bit | Name  | Description          |
| --- | ----- | -------------------- |
| 7   | N/A   |                      |
| 6   | ACME  |                      |
| 5   | N/A   |                      |
| 4   | N/A   |                      |
| 3   | N/A   |                      |
| 2   | ADTS2 | Auto trigger source  |
| 1   | ADTS1 | Auto trigger source  |
| 0   | ADTS0 | Auto trigger source  |


</br></br>
#### Prescaler

The prescaler setting determines the clock speed of the ADC. The microcontroller clock speed is 16MHz. This is divided by the prescaler value to get the ADC clock. For example, if the prescaler were 32, the ADC clock would be 500KHz (16MHz/32 = 500KHz).

| ADPS2 | ADPS1 | ADPS0 | Prescaler Value |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | --------------- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     | 2               |
| 0     | 0     | 1     | 2               |
| 0     | 1     | 0     | 4               |
| 0     | 1     | 1     | 8               |
| 1     | 0     | 0     | 16              |
| 1     | 0     | 1     | 32              |
| 1     | 1     | 0     | 64              |
| 1     | 1     | 1     | 128             |


</br></br>
#### Auto Trigger

When **ADATE** is on, auto triggering of the ADC is enabled. The ADC starts conversion on the positive edge of the trigger signal.

The trigger source is selected with the **ADTS** bits in **ADCSRB**. Leaving them all at 0 will enable _free running mode_.


</br></br>
#### ADC Interrupts

Interrupts are enabled by setting the **ADIE** bit.

When ADC conversion is complete, the data registers are updated, and then the ADC interrupt is raised. This sets the **ADIF** bit.

When an ISR is called (to handle the interrupt) the **ADIF** bit is cleared.


</br></br>
### Sample Code

Here is an example of how we might configure the ADC:

    // Disable interrupts globally
    cli();

    // Clear registers to be sure they're all at zero
    ADCSRA = 0;
    ADCSRB = 0;
    ADMUX = 0;

    // Set the reference voltage to internal
    // Some values here are already 0, but setting anyway for clarity
    ADMUX |= (1 << REFS0);
    ADMUX |= (0 << REFS1);
    
    // Select ADC0 (pin A0) for input
    ADMUX |= (0 << MUX0);
    ADMUX |= (0 << MUX1);
    ADMUX |= (0 << MUX2);
    ADMUX |= (0 << MUX3);

    // Left align the ADC value (makes it easy to read highest 8 bits from one register)
    ADMUX |= (1 << ADLAR);

    // Set the ADC clock with a prescaler of 32 (16MHz/32 = 500KHz)
    ADCSRA |= (1 << ADPS2);
    ADCSRA |= (0 << ADPS1);
    ADCSRA |= (1 << ADPS0);

    // Enable auto-trigger
    ADCSRA |= (1 << ADATE);

    // Enable ADC Interrupts
    ADCSRA |= (1 << ADIE);

    // Enable ADC
    ADCSRA |= (1 << ADEN);

    // Start ADC
    ADCSRA |= (1 << ADSC);

    // Enable interrupts globally
    sei();

## Sampling Rate and Internal Clock

There's one confusing issue that needs clearing up. The difference between the ADC's clock rate and the sampling rate.

The ADC's clock rate is set based on the clock rate of the microcontroller, which is 16MHz, and the prescaler. In the example above, the prescaler is 32, which makes the ADC clock operate at 500KHz.

This, however, is not the sampling rate. The sampling rate is somewhat lower than the clock rate, as it takes several cycles to convert the analogue signal to digital.

According to the ATMega328P datasheet, the ADC uses a _Sample and Hold_ architecture. This takes 13 cycles to complete.

If we divide 13 by 500KHz, we find that the time taken for each sample (conversion) is 26 microseconds. If we invert this (1 / 26Î¼s) we find that we're getting 38,461 samples per second, a sampling rate of about **38.5KHz**.
