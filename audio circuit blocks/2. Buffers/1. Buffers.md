# Expressing Sound as Electricity
## Pickups

Before we can really understand what a buffer circuit does, we need to know a bit about the pickups on an electric guitar.

The electric guitar has one or more pickups. These could be single coil, P90, or humbuckers. We're going to ignore active pickups for now. Let's just focus on single coil pickups for now.

To simplify it, pickups are a very long winding of copper wire around a few magnets. That's six magnets for a six string guitar, and from 5,000 to 10,000 windings in the copper coil.

When the string above the pickup is vibrating, it causes the magnetic field to fluctuate, which translates to a small electric signal. This signal passes from the pickup to the cable, and then to your amp. Probably through a few effects pedals on the way for good measure.

So to summarise, a pickup _passively_ converts a string's vibration into a very small electrical signal.

## Voltage and Current

The electric signal that the pickup creates represents the sound that the guitarist is playing. It will be an AC signal, meaning that it [oscilates up and down](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/Audio%20Theory/2.%20Frequencies.md). A simple AC signal is shown here:

</br></br>
What exactly is oscillating up and down? In the electric signal, this is the voltage. The voltage rises above, and drops below, a central point, which is commonly equal to ground.

This means that the _amount_ of voltage represents the _amplitude_ of a signal. The _speed_ at which the voltage changes will represent the _frequency_.

It is important to be aware though, that this signal is fairly weak. A typical single coil pickup will generate from 100mV to 200mV [RMS](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/Audio%20Theory/1.%20Waveforms.md#root-mean-square-rms).

The voltage generated depends on how hard the musician is playing. striking the string harder creates more vibration, which generates more voltage. Some pickups will also create more voltage than others.

A single coil pickup typically has as an _impedance_ of 6KΩ to 15KΩ. If you're not familiar with impedance, just think of it as resistance for now, and I'll explain more later.

Of course, we can use Ohms law to work out the current from this. 100mV with 6KΩ impedance yields about 17µA (microamps). 200mV with 15KΩ means about 13µA of current.

The key takeaway here is, the pickups create an electric signal, but it is _very weak_.



* why we need them
  * tone suck
  * lack of current
* impedance
  * Guitar impedance
  * impedance matching
  * Adding current
