# Buffers
## Pickups

Before we can really understand what a buffer circuit does, we need to know a bit about the pickups on an electric guitar.

The electric guitar has one or more pickups. These could be single coil, P90, or humbuckers. We're going to ignore active pickups for now. Let's just focus on single coil pickups for now.

To simplify it, pickups are a very long winding of copper wire around a few magnets. That's six magnets for a six string guitar, and from 5,000 to 10,000 windings in the copper coil.

When the string above the pickup is vibrating, it causes the magnetic field to fluctuate, which translates to a small electric signal. This signal passes from the pickup to the cable, and then to your amp. Probably through a few effects pedals on the way for good measure.

So to summarise, a pickup _passively_ converts a string's vibration into a very small electrical signal.
