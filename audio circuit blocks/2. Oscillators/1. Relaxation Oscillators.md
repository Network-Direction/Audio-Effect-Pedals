# Relaxation Oscillators
A relaxation oscillator is a simple type of oscillator circuit that uses an OpAmp. These are the basis of LFO’s, which are used in modulation circuits, such as chorus and phasers.

## Ground and Virtual Ground
In this example, we have a TL072, connected to +9v and 0v. This means the non-inverting input is biassed to 4.5v (via R2). This is our virtual ground, which is half the voltage range, representing the midpoint of our wave.

In other cases, we would have two power supplies, with one providing a negative voltage (eg, +9v, -9v). In this case, the non-inverting input would connect to ground (still via R2), which sets 0v as the midpoint of the wave.

</br></br>


## Oscillation
R2 and R3 act as a voltage divider. These should always be even, so the output on pin1 is always halved.

For example, if the output is 6v, we have a 1.5v difference between the output and the virtual ground. R3 will drop half of that (0.75v), which means there is 5.25v at the non-inverting input.

</br></br>


### Charging the Capacitor
If C1 happens to be discharged, it will present 0v. That means there will also be 0v on the inverting input. This is why the output is at max (we’ll just assume 6v is the max for simplicity).

However, the output will pass current through R1 into C1, as this is a valid path to the ground. As this happens, C1 starts to charge, which means the voltage on the inverting input also grows.

Eventually, the inverting input will have a higher voltage than the non-inverting input. This causes the opamp to drive the output voltage down to the lower limit, and the voltage on the non-inverting input to change.

</br></br>


### Discharging the Capacitor
When this happens, the direction of the current changes. This causes the capacitor to start discharging through R1. When the capacitor discharges enough, the voltage on the inverting input will be lower than the non-inverting input, and the output will flip again.

This charging and discharging process actually adds simple hysteresis. The voltage point that the capacitor charges to effectively sets an upper threshold. However, in this simple circuit, there is no lower threshold.

A schmitt trigger is a more advanced version of this, which uses a resistor feedback network to add both upper and lower thresholds.

## Wave Types
The type of wave we see will be different depending on where it is measured.

If we measure the wave on an oscilloscope at the output pin (pin 1) of the opamp, we will see something close to a square wave. This is because the opamp is driving the output voltage between extremes.

I say close to a square wave, as it won’t be a perfect wave. The tops and bottoms of the waves will be a little curved. This is because of the slew rate of the opamp. The slew rate is the maximum rate at which the opamp can change its output voltage, which is measured in volts per microsecond (V/µs).

Because it takes time to push the output between the minimum and maximum output voltages, there will be some curve in the wave.

If we read the signal on the inverting input, we will get a sawtooth wave. This is because of the constant charging and discharging of the capacitor.

Once again, this will have a slight curve to it, as capacitors charge and discharge at a non-linear rate.

</br></br>


## Frequency
The frequency of the output is controlled by R1 and C1. Of course, messing with R2 and R3 will also change the frequency, but it’s the capacitor’s charge and discharge rate that really matter.

This can be calculated as:

```math
f = {1 \over 2 \times RC}
```

</br></br>

Resistance is measured in ohms and capacitance in farads (so remember to convert uF to F).

In this example, a 1K resistor and a 1uF capacitor result in an oscillation frequency of about 159Hz.

In the real world, we will see some variation on the frequency and wave shapes, depending on the quality and tolerances of the components used in the circuit.
