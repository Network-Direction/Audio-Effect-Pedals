# RC Filter Circuits
Another way to create these circuits is with resistors and capacitors. These are also passive filters.

This is a simple RC LPF, where higher frequencies are shunted to ground:

A high-pass filter swaps the resistor and capacitor, to pass the higher frequencies, while shunting the lower ones to ground.

## LC or RC?
Low frequency applications, that is up to about 100KHz, are generally made with RC filters. Frequencies above 100KHz are generally made with RLC filters.
The RLC filter is an LC filter with the addition of resistors.

## Multi-Stage Filters
When there is only one reactive component in place (eg, one capacitor, as in the RC circuit) it is called a first-order filter or one-pole filter. LC filters are called second-order filters, as they have two reactive components (the inductor and the capacitor).

We can also create multiple stages to increase the number of reactive components:

Creating more stages has two effects:
* Creating a steeper slope
* Increasing attenuation

This means we can make n-order filters (where n is the number of stages), to make a pass filter more ‘accurate’. However, the signal will decrease (meaning a gain of less than one), requiring an active component to boost the signal at some point.
