# Opamp Buffers

Opamp buffers are fantastic, as they're very simple and easy to make.

As you can see, this is just an [opamp configured as a voltage follower](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/audio%20circuit%20blocks/1.%20OpAmps/2.%20Voltage%20Follower.md).

This example uses a TL072, which is a JFET based opamp. Other JFET opamps are also quite useful, the RC4558 is another common choice. These are good opamps for a buffer as they offer high impedance on input (nearly zero current flows on the + and - pins), and are very low noise.

This means it has unity gain, just like the transitor versions. It also supplies additional power by means of a 9v power supply. Of course, it doesn't have to strictly be 9v, but this is common because of 9v batteries being common.

As with other buffers, there are capacitors on the signal input and output to block DC. There's also a resistor, R1, to protect the opamp pins.

The impedance is effectively controlled by R2. In this case, we have a 1M resistor, so we have 1M input impedance. This is really the minimum value we would want. 2M or more might be even better.
