# Building Blocks
## No Buffer

If we don't have a buffer in an effects pedal, current will be drawn from the source of the signal. That is, from the pickups.

The problem is, the pickups can't produce much current, so they get _loaded down_, and the [tone of the signal suffers](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/audio%20circuit%20blocks/3.%20Buffers/1.%20Signals%20and%20Impedance.md).

The goal of a buffer is to address this issue.
