## No Buffer

If we don't have a buffer in an effects pedal, current will be drawn from the source of the signal. That is, from the pickups.

The problem is, the pickups can't produce much current, so they get _loaded down_, and the [tone of the signal suffers](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/audio%20circuit%20blocks/3.%20Buffers/1.%20Signals%20and%20Impedance.md).

The goal of a buffer is to address this issue.

## Adding a Buffer

When we add a buffer, we use a transistor or an opamp that's connected to an external power supply. Often this is a 9v DC power supply for an effects pedal.

The signal itself doesn't change in the buffer. It is not amplified or attenuated. However, if the effects circuit needs to draw more current, it is now at liberty to do so, as this can be provided by the power supply.

As mentioned, a buffer can be based around a transistor (either BJT or JFET), or an opamp. In the following sections, we'll see some examples of how a transistor base buffer works.
