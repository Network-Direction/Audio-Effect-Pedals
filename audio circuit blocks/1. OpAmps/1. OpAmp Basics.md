# OpAmp Basics

An Operational Amplifier is an IC that can be used for many different things. It’s commonly used as:
* A comparator, to convert analogue signals to digital
* A buffer, to lower the impedance on a signal
* An amplifier, to increase the gain of a signal
* A differentiator, which compares two values and provides an output
* An integrator, which outputs a new signal based on an input and time

## OpAmp Structure

The standard symbol for an OpAmp is a triangle, with 3 or more pins:

</br>
There are two pins to take input signals, which are labelled with a plus and a minus symbol. These are known as the _inverting_ (-) and _non-inverting_ (+) inputs.

These inputs ‘see’ a signal represented as a voltage. They do not sink or source voltage.

Sometimes the opamp may be drawn with the ‘+’ at the top (like the example above), and other times the ‘-’ may be at the top. Both of these are valid.

</br>
The **Vout** pin provides an output signal. The voltage of this will vary depending on the signals applied to the inverting and non-inverting inputs (more on this soon). This pin _can_ sink or source a current.

OpAmps come in an IC package, either through hole (DIP) or surface mount (SOIC). Each package can have one, two, or four independent OpAmps within. However the same two power supply pins are used for all the OpAmps in the package.

For this reason, the OpAmps in a schematic often don’t show the power supply pins on all op amps, if several come from one package.


</br></br>
## Power

The OpAmp is powered by the two power supply pins. These are needed so the output pin can sink/source current.

These are typically a positive and negative current, such as +5v and -5v. However, in small audio circuits, it’s typical for one to be +9v, and the other to be 0v, to match a 9 volt battery.

When designing a circuit, we can choose the values we use here. There is a limit to the power we can supply, but we don’t have to stick to that value only. We could use 10V, 5V, +9v/0v, whatever we want, as long as it’s within the OpAmp’s supported range.

</br>
The power supplies in the OpAmp are also called **rails.** The output of the OpAmp cannot be larger than the upper rail, and cannot be lower than the lower rail.

So, if an OpAmp has +10v and -10v, the output pin cannot exceed 10V.

In reality, most OpAmps cannot reach these values exactly. They can usually only get within a certain limit of the rail. For example, an OpAmp powered with +10V/-10V may be able to practically output +9V/-9V on the output pin.

In some cases, we can use _rail-to-rail_ OpAmps, which can reach the input power rails.



</br></br>
## Controlling the Output

The whole purpose of the OpAmp is to set an output voltage, which can vary depending on the inverting and non-inverting input.

The basic rule is, an op amp will attempt to adjust its output, so the two inputs match. This may not make a lot of sense right away, but it will.

</br>
It continually monitors the voltages on the inputs. If the voltage on the non-inverting pin (the + pin) is higher than the non-inverting (the - pin), then the OpAmp will start driving the output higher and higher until one of two conditions is satisfied:

1. The two inputs become even again

2. The upper rail is reached


</br>
For example, if the inverting input has a 2v signal, and the non-inverting input has a 3v signal, then the op amp will drive the output voltage up until it hits its limit.

</br>
The opposite happens if the voltage on the inverting input is higher. The output voltage is driven down to its lowest possible value.

## Comparator

This is the op amp working in its simplest way. How could it be used in this fashion? It could be used as a comparator. That is, we could tie the inverting input to the ground (0v), and feed an analogue sine wave into the non-inverting input.

The voltage on the non-inverting input will constantly change as the wave moves up and down.

The input wave oscillates around zero volts, so half the time the non-inverting input will have the highest voltage (as it’s greater than 0v, the ground), which drives the output all the way up. The other half of the time the inverting input will have the highest voltage, which drives the output right down.

</br>
The effect of this is to convert an analogue or sine wave into a digital or square wave.
