# Types of Opamps

An opamp is built using a lot of internal components such as transistors. When it comes to just using opamps, we don't generally need to know the details around what's inside the opamp package.

However, it's good to know that there are three main ways an opamp can be constructed:
* JFET transistor based
* BJT transistor based
* MOSFET transistor based (known as CMOS)

## JFET Opamps

Common JFET opamps include the TL06x series, the TL07x series, and the TL08x series.

### Advantages

The biggest advantage of a JFET opamp is its **high input impedance**. This makes them particularly useful for applications like buffers, where we expect a high impedance input.

JFETs are **low noise**. This is random fluctuations in voltage or current that happen within the transistor. JFET opamps are good in certain audio applications for this reason.
