# Types of Opamps

An opamp is built using a lot of internal components such as transistors. When it comes to just using opamps, we don't generally need to know the details around what's inside the opamp package.

However, it's good to know that there are three main ways an opamp can be constructed:
* JFET transistor based
* BJT transistor based
* CMOS opamps (sometimes called MOSFET opamps)


</br></br>
## JFET Opamps
Common JFET opamps include the TL06x series, the TL07x series, and the TL08x series.


</br></br>
### Advantages

The biggest advantage of a JFET opamp is its **high input impedance**. This makes them particularly useful for applications like buffers, where we expect a high impedance input.

JFETs are **low noise**. This is random fluctuations in voltage or current that happen within the transistor. JFET opamps are good in certain audio applications for this reason.

They have a **wide bandwidth**. The bandwidth is the range of frequencies that the opamp can reliably support.

Typically, they also have a very low **input bias current**. We generally think of opamp terminals as not passing any current at all, but that's just conceptual. They have to pass _some_ current. JFET opamps require a very low current on these pins to operate.


</br></br>
### Disadvantages

A JFET opamp has a higher **offset voltage** than other types. In an ideal opamp, if the input voltages are zero, the output will be zero. In practice though, there is an _offset voltage_, which is a slight difference in DC voltage between the two input terminals. There are some special JFET opamps (such as the OPA2134) which have low offset voltages.

They also have a larger **offset drift**. This is a slight variation in the output voltage over time.

JFET opamps may also require a higher **supply voltage** to operate.


</br></br>
## BJT Opamps
Common BJT opamps include the LM741, the LM384, and the RC4558.


</br></br>
### Advantages

BJT opamps are all about **high gain**, which is useful if a large amplification is needed.

BJT op-amps can have a wide range of bandwidths. Some low-power BJT op-amps (like LM358, LM324) have limited bandwidth, whereas high-performance BJT op-amps (like NE5532 and OP27) can have higher bandwidth than many JFET op-amps.

They have lower **offset voltage** and better **offset drift** than JFET opamps.


</br></br>
### Disadvantages

They have a low **input impedance**, making them less suitable for interfacing with high impedance sources, such as electric guitar pickups.

They also have higher **bias input current**, and a more limited **bandwidth** than JFETs.


</br></br>
## CMOS Opamps
### Advantages

CMOS opamps usually have very low **power consumption**, which can be useful for battery powered circuits.

Like JFETs, CMOS opamps have a high **input impedance**, meaning they can interface with guitar pickups. They are also **low noise**.


</br></br>
### Disadvantages

CMOS opamps usually have a lower **gain** than BJT opamps, and a much more limited **bandwidth** than BJT or JFET opamps. Some special models have a much higher bandwidth.

Their **offset voltage** is also higher, which may require extra circuitry to compensate for.

# Other Characteristics
## Rail to Rail

CMOS opamps are typically _rail to rail_ opamps on input, output, or both. This means they can operate all the way to their advertised input or output voltages.

JFET and BJT opamps aren't typically rail to rail. This means it's easier to get clipping from these opamps, which may be useful in distortion circuits.

In a single power supply case, such as when an opamp has +9v on the positive rail and 0v on the negative, this can have an interesting result. JFET opamps such as the TL07x series, usually can't output all the way down to the lower rail. This means their output can _swing_ between +1v and +9v. Some opamp models can get very _close_ to 0v, but not all the way there.

The **common mode range** is the range of input values that an opamp can process, while still maintaining proper operation.


## Slew Rate

The **slew rate** is how fast the voltage can change over time. This is expressed as **V/µs**. Think of an AC audio signal that is oscillating up and down. The opamp needs to have a slew rate that is fast enough to change the output voltage to represent the signal.

JFET based opamps typically have a higher slew rate. The TL07x is about **13V/µs**, making it good for audio applications.

The LM358, which is BJT based, has a slew rate of about 0.3V/µs, which is much slower. This can create noticable distortion in audio signals.

The TLV2372, a CMOS opamp, has a slew rate of about 1.3V/µs. Better than the BJT for audio, but nowhere close to the JFET.


</br></br>
## Phase Reversal

This is where the output of an opamp suddenly inverts its polarity. This is caused by the input voltage being outside the _common-mode_ range.

An example of this is shown here:

![000](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a87158-6e7d-4231-ac7f-4deb5b686471)


This has an input sine wave, as shown in green. The **TL072** opamp is powered by +9v on the positive rail, and 0v on the negative.

The circuit is meant to be a voltage rectifier. The output follows the positive half of the wave correctly. Once the input wave goes below zero, the polarity shifts, and goes up to the positive rail.

Why does this happen? The TL072 opamp has a common mode input range from the negative supply range to the positive. When the input is below 0v, the input is outside the common mode range, and the opamp simply doesn't understand it.

In a case like this, different opamps may behave in different ways. The TL07x series datasheet says _Avoid input voltage values below 1 V to prevent phase reversal where output goes high_. Some opamps will have phase reveral under certain conditions, and the image above shows this.

Some models of JFET opamp, such as the OPA1642, include internal _clamping_ circuitry to prevent phase reversal. CMOS opamps are usually designed to prevent phase reversal.
