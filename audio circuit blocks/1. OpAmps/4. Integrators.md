# Integrators

An integrator gets its name from being able to perform _integration_, a type of calculus. Don’t let this worry you though. While it would definitely be helpful to understand the maths, we can focus more on how the circuit is built, and how it functions.

## Current In OpAmps
Before getting right into integrators, let’s see the _current controller_. That is, how we can control current with an op amp. Let’s start with a non-inverting amplifier, where we have a 2v input signal:

![current-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c645190b-b463-4811-8330-bf04207c32a7)

</br>
We now want to think about the current in this circuit. The first thing to know is that the two inputs have an extremely high _impedance._ That is, they resist the flow of current. This means that we effectively have no current flowing through these pins.

The Vout pin on the other hand, can source or sink current. That means current can flow out of this pin, or into this pin.

</br>
To calculate the current across the two resistors we can use ohm's law. We have 20K of resistance and 4v of potential. We divide 4v by 20,000 ohms to get 0.0002 amps (200uA, or micro-amps). That is, there is 200uA of current flowing from Vout, across R1 and R2, to ground.

</br>
What if we changed the value of R1? This is where it gets interesting. Let’s say we increased it to 20K. That should affect the current right? Don’t forget that changing the resistor will change the output voltage of the opamp. We would have 6v on the output pin.

Now when we calculate the current, we divide 6v by 30,000 ohms, and still end up with 200uA of current.

</br>
What we can see here is that changing R1 will affect the gain of the opamp (that is the voltage on the output pin), but it will not affect the current.

What does affect the current? Two things:
* The input voltage on the non-inverting input
* The resistance of R2

## Integration

A quick detour to talk about integration... Not too much maths though.

Think of a curve on a graph. There are times that we want to calculate the area underneath the curve. In the example below, we’re interested in finding the blue area under the curve between points a and b.

There are different ways this could be estimated, but to really work this out properly, we use _integral calculus_.

</br>
Why would we want to know this for the purpose of electronic circuits? Here’s one good reason.

Think of the x-axis as _time_. As time passes, there is more and more area under the curved line. We could even draw another graph to show how the area under the curve gets larger with time.

In an electronic circuit, we could express this with voltage. That is, over time the voltage will change depending on how much area there is under the graph.

## Integrator Circuits

Let’s leave the maths alone for now, and see what happens in the op amp based circuit.

</br>
The integrator is based on the non-inverting amplifier. However, instead of a pair of resistors creating a voltage divider, we have a capacitor and a resistor. This creates a different type of feedback path.

Whenever we see a resistor and capacitor together, we need to think about time. That’s because the capacitor charges and discharges at some rate, defined by the values of the resistor and capacitor.

</br>
Because there’s a capacitor here, we need to think about current as well as voltage. When we apply a current to a capacitor, it begins to charge. This is why it was important that we know about current in op amp circuits first.

If we assume we’re starting with a completely discharged capacitor, the voltage on both sides of the capacitor will be the same. Current will also flow freely through the capacitor, making it look like a short circuit.

As the capacitor charges, the voltage across the capacitor will change. The op amp will adjust its output voltage to compensate. As we’ve seen however, the current across the capacitor and resistor will not change.

</br>
Normally capacitors charge at a non-linear rate. If we put a normal resistor/capacitor charging rate on a graph, we would have a curved line.

</br>
However, as the op amp is able to compensate for changes in voltage, and can keep the current steady, this capacitor will charge at a constant (linear) rate. If we graphed it, it would look like a straight line.

</br>
So, while the input signal (voltage) remains steady, the output will grow at a steady rate. If a change on the input signal were to cause the capacitor to discharge, then the voltage would decrease at a steady rate.

This is where the integration part of the circuit comes in. If you give it some signal, like a square wave that you could plot on a graph, the output will effectively tell you how much area is under that graph by its continually changing output voltage.

</br>
What could we use this for? It could be used in different timing circuits for one. In the realm of audio processing and effects pedals, it’s useful for manipulating a signal. For one, it can convert a square wave signal to a triangle signal. It could also be used as part of an oscillator circuit to generate a signal of a particular frequency.
