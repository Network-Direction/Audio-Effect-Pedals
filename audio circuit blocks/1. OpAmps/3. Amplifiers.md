# Inverting and Non-Inverting Amplifiers

As the name suggests, an op amp can also amplify a signal. There are two ways this can be done:
* Inverting
* Non-inverting

A **non-inverting** amplifier outputs an amplified signal in the same phase as the input. An **inverting** amplifier outputs an amplified signal that is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal.

</br>
Does it matter which we use? For simply amplifying audio in small circuits like effects pedals, not normally. We can’t tell the difference when a signal is out of phase.

Just for amplification, it comes down to preference.

## Non-Inverting Configuration

A non-inverting amplifier receives a signal on the non-inverting input. There is a negative feedback network, which connects the output to the inverting input.

It’s important to note at this point, that in most cases we always want to use negative feedback (feedback connected to the inverting input). This is because _positive_ feedback causes **oscillation**. Sometimes this is a good thing, but only in cases where we specifically want it (like a waveform generator).

</br>
The feedback network now consists of two resistors, forming a voltage divider, connecting to ground.

How does this help? Well, we know that resistors drop voltage and a signal passes over them. In fact, since they’re connected to ground (zero volts), the two of them must drop all the voltage on Vout.

</br>
Let’s consider a simple example. Let’s say both resistors are 10K, and the input signal on the non-inverting input is 2v.

</br>
What will happen here? We can assume that the inverting input is 0v to start with, so the opamp will start driving up the voltage on Vout. Let’s say that Vout increases to 2v.

What happens here? We know that resistors drop voltage proportionally. As R1 and R2 are connected to ground (0v) together, they must drop the entire 2v on Vout. They are equal, so they’ll share the load evenly and drop 1v each.

So, R1 drops 1v, and R2 drops 1v. What will the voltage on the inverting input be? If we start with 2v at Vout, and R1 drops 1v, then the inverting input must have a voltage of 1v.

The result is that it is still lower than the non-inverting input. So, the op amp continues to drive the voltage on Vout higher. Let’s say it gets to 4v now.

</br>
The feedback resistors still need to drop all 4 volts, as they’re connected to ground. Being equal, they will drop 2v each, leaving 2v on the inverting input.

The inverting input and non-inverting input are now even, so the op amp will hold Vout at a steady 4 volts.

</br>
What has happened here? The result is, the op amp has amplified the input signal. In this case, it has doubled the input voltage. We say this is a **gain** of 2. That is, the output is 2x the input.

We can adjust the values of the two resistors to change the gain. The formula for the gain looks like this (where ‘A’ is the gain):

```math
A = 1 + {R1 \over R2}
```

</br>
Notice that in a non-inverting amplifier, the gain will always be greater than 1.

Also note that in some diagrams, R1 is called Rf, which means ‘feedback resistor’

</br>
As another example, what if we Changed R1 to 20K? In this case, it will drop more of the voltage, requiring Vout to be higher to make the two inputs equal. Using the formula, we get 1 + 20/10, which equals 3. That means we would then have a gain of three, and Vout would be 6v.

It’s very important to understand that there is a limit on the gain of the amplifier. It cannot go beyond its power supply rails. We can never create power from nothing. So, if the max rail was, say, 9 volts, Vout cannot possibly go higher than 9 volts either (and then only on a rail-to-rail op amp).

## Inverting Configuration

An inverting amplifier takes the opposite approach in its configuration. The non-inverting input is tied to ground (0 volts), and the signal comes in through the voltage divider.

</br>
The idea is mostly the same as with a non-inverting amplifier though.

The non-inverting input will always be zero volts, so the op amp will do whatever it takes to get the inverting input equal to zero volts as well.

</br>
Let’s see another example, where we have two even resistors in the feedback network, and a 2v input signal. To see how this configuration works, we reason backwards.

![inverting-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5852af-279d-43d4-9507-4daba99ed860)

</br>
The non-inverting input is 0v, so to make the inverting input 0v as well, R2 will need to drop 2 volts. R1 and R2 are a voltage divider, and they are the same size, so they will always drop the same voltage. We can say then, that R1 also needs to drop 2 volts.

In this case, what does Vout need to be for all this to make sense? It would also have to be -2 volts.

</br>
We can see that the output has been inverted. In this example, the gain is -1. The formula for this is:

```math
A = -{R1 \over R2}
```

</br>
Unlike the non-inverting amplifier, the gain does not have to be greater than 1. The polarity of the output however, will always be the opposite of the input signal.

As with the non-inverting amplifier, we can adjust the values of R1 and R2 to change the gain. As before, the limits of the gain will depend on the positive and negative power supplies.
