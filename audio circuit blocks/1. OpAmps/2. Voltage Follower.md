# Voltage Follower

So when the voltages on the inputs are different, the op amp will drive the output up or down until:
* The two inputs become even again
* The upper rail is reached

</br>
We’ve seen cases where the output is driven all the way up or all the way down. How could the inputs ever become even again? The answer is with feedback.

This is where we send some of the output signal back to one of the inputs like this:

</br>
Now what will happen if we connect a 2v signal to the non-inverting input, while the inverting input is 0v?

The opamp will start increasing the output until it also reaches 2v, and it will stop there. Why? Because of the feedback path. When the output is 2 volts, the inverting input will also be 2 volts. Both inputs are now equal, which means the state will hold here.

What if the signal now drops to 1v? The inverting input now has a higher voltage, so it will drive the output voltage down. As it does this, the voltage on the inverting input also goes down. Eventually it will settle at 1v, as the two inputs are even once again.

</br>
This type of circuit is called a voltage follower, as the output voltage exactly follows the input voltage. Why would we ever want this? I won’t go into great detail yet, but this allows us to recreate the signal faithfully, while allowing more current to be drawn.

This is often found in the input stage of a guitar pedal, as guitar pickups can create a signal using voltage, but produce extremely small current. The voltage follower, also called a buffer, doesn’t alter the signal in any way, but allows the rest of the circuit to draw more current than would previously be possible.
