# Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)

The Low Frequency Oscillator, or LFO, does exactly what the name suggests. It generates a signal with a very low frequency, somewhere below the human hearing range. An LFO will typically produce a signal that operates from about 0.1Hz to 20Hz.

What’s the point of this if we can’t hear it? It’s not meant to be a frequency that we can hear. Rather, it’s meant to be a frequency, or signal, that can control some other block in the effects pedal. This type of signal is often called a Control Voltage (CV), as it's used to control some other module.

An LFO is commonly used in a modulation effect, such as a phaser or chorus.

## Rate and Depth
The simple oscillator shown below is based on a schmitt-trigger / OpAmp integrator topology. In fact, it’s very similar to the LFO found in the **MXR Phase 90** phaser pedal.

Using the circuit shown above, we get the very low frequency of 0.75Hz. This will generate different waveforms depending on where in the circuit we measure the wave.
When we measure the output of the opamp, we get an output signal that is close to a square wave. It’s not quite a square wave, as the frequency is so low. My oscilloscope can’t even measure the frequency correctly as it’s so low!

When we measure on the part of the circuit labelled ‘signal’, we get something close to a triangle wave. This is typically the signal that we would feed into some other module in an effects pedal.

In both cases, the frequency is about 0.75Hz. We can vary this by changing the values of either C1, R1, or both. Here’s an example of changing R1 from 470K to 150K:

</br></br>

This changes the frequency to 22.5Hz. The faster frequency creates a signal that’s much closer to a true triangle wave. The same is true of the output of the opamp. It is a higher frequency, and much closer to a square wave.

</br></br>

When designing a LFO, we would typically choose a suitable capacitor, as we can’t change that later, and replace R1 with a potentiometer (or put one inline with R1). This potentiometer then controls the frequency of the output. In effect pedal terms, we call this the **rate**.

Some LFO’s will have another controllable parameter called the **depth**. This is changing the amplitude of the wave. Think of depth as the distance between the two peaks of the waveform.

We can change the depth by changing the values of R2 and R3. Again, this is a case where we would switch one of them with a potentiometer.
</br></br>

In this example, R1 is still 150K, and I have replaced R3 with a 470K resistor. This affects the circuit in two ways. Firstly the peak-to-peak voltage is significantly lower (it was 4.14V before, and 209mV now). So we have lowered the depth.

This has also had an effect on the frequency of the wave. It’s now at about 485Hz. Note that this is just for example. As mentioned previously, an LFO should really only operate up to around 20Hz.
