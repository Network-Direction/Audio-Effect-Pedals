# RC Filter Circuits
Another way to create these circuits is with resistors and capacitors. These are also passive filters.

This is a simple RC LPF, where higher frequencies are shunted to ground:

A high-pass filter swaps the resistor and capacitor, to pass the higher frequencies, while shunting the lower ones to ground.

## LC or RC?
Low frequency applications, that is up to about 100KHz, are generally made with RC filters. Frequencies above 100KHz are generally made with RLC filters.
The RLC filter is an LC filter with the addition of resistors.
