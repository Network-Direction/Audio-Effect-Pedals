## Active Filters
The previous examples are passive filters, as they only use passive components. As these attenuate the overall signal, resulting in a gain of less than one, we often need to create active filters to boost the signal further.

This means using active components like a transistor or op amp:

An active filter like this one is also known as a first order filter. This is because it only has a single filtering stage.

It is important to note though, that while a passive filter has an infinite frequency response (in theory, the right combination of components can reach and filter any frequency), an active filter is limited by the bandwidth and feedback network of the op amp. This means an active HPF will have a maximum frequency limit it can filter at.

This means the opamp will have a frequency response curve. We need to select the right op amp, and design the feedback appropriately to get the frequencies we need. This is where we want to use low tolerance resistors and capacitors.

For the most part though, this isnâ€™t much of a problem with analogue audio. Video and other high-frequency applications are another matter.

## Second Order Filters
A second order filter, also called a two-pole filter, is made of two RC filter sections that are connected together. While a normal filter would have a rolloff of 6dB per octave (20dB per decade), this can achieve 12dB per octave (40dB per decade).

This means we can use second order filters to create a very steep slope, which in turn means that we can create filters for very specific frequencies.

More stages can be cascaded to get a steeper slope. 3rd order = 60dB per decade, 4th order = 80dB per decade, etc.
