# LC Filter Circuits

In a circuit, filters are created with specific combinations of inductors, resistors, and capacitors. This relies on two basic principles:
* Capacitors block DC current, while allowing AC current
* Inductors block AC current, while allowing DC current

Of course, that’s over simplified. Different values of capacitor and inductor are better at blocking or passing specific frequencies. In general, capacitors will pass higher frequencies, while inductors pass lower frequencies (which are closer to a flat DC signal).

These are called passive filters, as they are made from passive components. That is, there are no transistors or op amps to boost the signal (the output level will always be less than the input).

This is a low-pass LC filter:

Higher frequencies are shunted to ground, while lower frequencies are allowed to pass across the inductor. The values of the two components determine the roll-off.

This is a high-pass LC filter:

</br></br>


Lower frequencies are shunted to ground, while the higher frequencies are allowed to pass.

A combination of the two can create a band-pass filter:

</br></br>


The values of the components are chosen so higher and lower frequencies are shunted to ground through the capacitor and inductor, while frequencies within the band are allowed to pass.

An LC filter tends to add a sharp boost near the roll-off point. This is the filter’s **resonant frequency**.
