# Phase Shift

Any time there are capacitors in the signal path of an audio circuit, we have the potential for _phase shift_. Any time we delay a signal, even slightly, we change the phase of the signal. As capacitors take time to charge and discharge, they introduce delay to the signal, and therefore phase-shift.


</br></br>
## Filters

RC filters, as their name implies, contain capacitors. That means that any time we use an RC filter in a circuit, we introduce phase shift. In many cases, this isn't overly important, as we can't really hear the difference in a small change in phase.

Where this becomes important is when we have two or more signals that get mixed together. This happens in modulation pedals (such as chorus) where there is a **wet** (modified) signal and a **dry** (unmodified) signal.

When the signals are mixed at the end of the signal path, the wet signal will have a slightly different phase to the dry signal. This may be desirable, or it may be a problem, all depending on the desired effect.
</br></br>

The phase-shift is introduced at the -3dB cutoff region. We can discover the _phase-angle_ at this point with a formula:

```math
φ = -arctan(2πfRC)
```
</br></br>

Don't worry too much about the math. The important thing is that the phase angle depends on the frequency of the filter. Notice also that the filter will affect the phase of certain frequencies more than others.

## All Pass Filter

The _All Pass Filter_ is the type of filter we use to shift the phase of a signal at a particular frequency.


</br></br>
### Basic Components

The basic idea behind the all pass filter is to split the input signal into two parts, and have them flow through an RC network (filter) like this one (images from electrosmash.com):

</br></br>

This is both a High Pass and Low Pass filter _superimposed_ on top of each other. The idea is that one copy of the signal is applied to **V1**, which is an HPF:

</br></br>

Another copy of the signal, shifted by 180-degrees is applied to **V2**, which is an LPF:

</br></br>

This can be analysed using _superposition_. This means we can analyse each of the two filters separately and then combine the results.


</br></br>
### Operational Amplifier

To improve the all pass filter, we add an opamp. This rotates the basic phase-shifter above, so we can pass in one signal and get two outputs. it is then connected to the inverting and non-inverting inputs of the opamp:

</br></br>

This bode plot shows the changes of phase at different points in the circuit.

</br></br>

Notice that the passive part of the filter loses some gain. This is because the phase shift is measured at the -3dB cutoff point.
The opamp is there to restore the signal to its original strength. The total phase shift from this filter is 90-degrees.
</br></br>

Changing the vales of the resistors (other than the feedback resistor) and the capacitor will change 3dB cutoff point for the filter, and therefore change the frequency at which the phase-shift occurs.

Practically, adjusting the resistor between the non-inverting input and the _virtual ground_ is the best option to adjust the frequency. This could be manual with a potentiometer, or we could use a FET as a variable resistor, which is biased from some other source.
