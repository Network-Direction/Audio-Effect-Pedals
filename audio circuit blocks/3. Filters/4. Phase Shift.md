# Phase Shift

Any time there are capacitors in the signal path of an audio circuit, we have the potential for _phase shift_. Any time we delay a signal, even slightly, we change the phase of the signal. As capacitors take time to charge and discharge, they introduce delay to the signal, and therefore phase-shift.

## Filters

RC filters, as their name implies, contain capacitors. That means that any time we use an RC filter in a circuit, we introduce phase shift. In many cases, this isn't overly important, as we can't really hear the difference in a small change in phase.

Where this becomes important is when we have two or more signals that get mixed together. This happens in modulation pedals (such as chorus) where there is a **wet** (modified) signal and a **dry** (unmodified) signal.

When the signals are mixed at the end of the signal path, the wet signal will have a slightly different phase to the dry signal. This may be desirable, or it may be a problem, all depending on the desired effect.

The phase-shift is introduced at the -3dB cutoff region. At this point, the signal at this frequency is 45-degrees out of phase. Notice that this means the filter will affect the phase of certain frequencies more than others.
