# Phase Shift

Any time there are capacitors in the signal path of an audio circuit, we have the potential for _phase shift_. Any time we delay a signal, even slightly, we change the phase of the signal. As capacitors take time to charge and discharge, they introduce delay to the signal, and therefore phase-shift.

## Filters

RC filters, as their name implies, contain capacitors. That means that any time we use an RC filter in a circuit, we introduce phase shift. In many cases, this isn't overly important, as we can't really hear the difference in a small change in phase.

Where this becomes important is when we have two or more signals that get mixed together. This happens in modulation pedals (such as chorus) where there is a **wet** (modified) signal and a **dry** (unmodified) signal.

When the signals are mixed at the end of the signal path, the wet signal will have a slightly different phase to the dry signal. This may be desirable, or it may be a problem, all depending on the desired effect.
</br></br>

The phase-shift is introduced at the -3dB cutoff region. We can discover the _phase-angle_ at this point with a formula:

```math
φ = -arctan(2πfRC)
```
</br></br>

Don't worry too much about the math. The important thing is that the phase angle depends on the frequency of the filter. Notice also that the filter will affect the phase of certain frequencies more than others.

## All Pass Filter

The _All Pass Filter_ is the type of filter we use to shift the phase of a signal at a particular frequency.

## Basic Components

The basic idea behind the all pass filter is to split the input signal into two parts, and have them flow through an RC network (filter) like this one (images from electrosmash.com):

</br></br>

This is both a High Pass and Low Pass filter _superimposed_ on top of each other. The idea is that one copy of the signal is applied to **V1**, which is an HPF:

</br></br>

Another copy of the signal, shifted by 180-degrees is applied to **V2**, which is an LPF:
