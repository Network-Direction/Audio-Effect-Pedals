# Envelope Followers
## The Envelope

A signal oscilates over time. A property of this signal is the [envelope](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/Audio%20Theory/4.%20Envelope.md).

The envelope is the overall amplitude of the signal over time.

## Envelope Followers

An envelope follower is a circuit that takes a signal as an input, determines the envelope of the signal, and output a voltage to represent the envelope.

This output voltage is often called a _control voltage_, or _CV_, as this can be used to control some other circuit.

Envelope followers are used a lot in modular synth. In effects pedals, we find them Wah effects and compressors.

## Basic Operation

The most basic envelope follower will work like this:
1. Input - Receive a signal
2. High Pass Filter - Remove any DC signal, and very low frequencies
3. Rectification - Usually a half-wave rectifier, which cuts out the negative half of a wave
4. Smoothing - Convert the rectified signal into a smooth DC voltage
5. Output - Produce the control voltage

This is a very simple envelope filter. More complicates filters will have extra settings, such as:
* Sensitivity control
* Buffers and amplifiers
* [Attack and Release](https://github.com/Network-Direction/Audio-Effect-Pedals/blob/Wha-Pedals/Audio%20Theory/4.%20Envelope.md) controls
* Gain controls
