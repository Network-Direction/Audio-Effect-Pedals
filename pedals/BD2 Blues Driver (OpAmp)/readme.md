# Modified Blues Driver

# Status
Tested on the breadboard
PCB printed, not tested yet

# Notes
Modified to use TL072 JFET Opamp, rather than the original JFET transistors.

The gyrator section uses 56nF capacitors in the original circuit. This version adds the option to replace with the 47nF or 68nF caps. However, this might slightly reduce or increase the filtering.
