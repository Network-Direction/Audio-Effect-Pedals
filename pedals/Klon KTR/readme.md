# Klon KTR

This is a revision to the original Klon Centaur

There are very few changes, just some updates for newer components, and some resistor changes in the tone stack.

NOTE: This still uses the 1N34A germanium diodes for clipping, which are extremely rare.

## Status
Schematic drawn, but not tested.

No PCB layout
