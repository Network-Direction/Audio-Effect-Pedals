# Doctor Q

Original **Doctor Q** was by Electro Harmonix from the 1970's. The schematics here incorporate the **Doctor Quack** mods from **Jack Orman**.

Another popular modification is called the **Nurse Quacky**


</br></br>
# How it Works
There are several main modules to the pedal:
1. Power
2. Input Buffer
3. Envelope Follower
4. Voltage Controlled Filter (Wah Effect)


</br></br>
## Power

The power module is extemely simple. There is no filtering, just raw 9 volt power supply.

The dual op amp package has a 9v power supply, with a 47-ohm resistor. This is a current-limiting resistor which provides minimal protection for the IC.


</br></br>
## Input Buffer

This is an addition to the original schematic. This is required to match impedance with the guitar, and preserve the original tone.

This is very common type of input buffer that biases the input to 4.5v, and provides capacitors to remove the DC offset.
