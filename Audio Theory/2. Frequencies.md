# Frequencies
The frequency of a wave is the total times its wavelength passes a given point in a second. This is measured in hertz (Hz).

We may think of a sound as one single sine wave, but it’s more complex. Even a single note on a single instrument produces multiple vibrations at multiple frequencies. We can think of a waveform as several different sine waves layered on top of each other.

The lowest of these frequencies is called the fundamental frequency. This provides a sound with its strongest audible pitch reference. That is, it’s the dominant frequency in a complex waveform.

A harmonic is a component of a sound that is above the audible fundamental frequency. There are usually a few of these, and they make up the harmonic spectrum of the sound. Each harmonic has a lower amplitude than the fundamental.

A harmonic is a multiple of the fundamental. For example, if the fundamental is 50Hz, the second harmonic will have a frequency of 100Hz. The third will be 150Hz, and so on.

This shows us that harmonics are related to the fundamental frequency of the waveform.

Overtones on the other hand, are also higher in frequency than the fundamental, but do not have any direct relation to the fundamental frequency.

## Timbre
Timbre refers to the tone, colour, or voice of a sound. The same note can be played on many different instruments, and they’ll all sound different.

This note is represented by the fundamental frequency. It’s the presence of harmonics and overtones that make up the timbre of the sound.

Second-order harmonics, also known as even harmonics, are even numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, the second and fourth harmonics are both even harmonics.

Third-order harmonics, known as odd harmonics, are odd numbered multiples of the fundamental frequencies.

Second-order harmonics are complementary to the fundamental frequency, and therefore create a rich, pleasing sound.

Third-order harmonics give a signal an edgier, more aggressive sound. These are commonly present in distortion pedals.

## Distortion
Distortion occurs when a change is made to an audio signal. This can be deliberate or accidental. When deliberate, distortion is usually a good thing.

In its simplest definition, distortion includes amplification, compression, and EQ changes. More practically though, we think of distortion as harmonic distortion, which is the result of clipping, saturation, or overdriving, in an audio circuit.

**Clipping** is when the signal is boosted so high that the audio circuit can not accurately reproduce it. The top and bottoms of the waveforms are clipped off, leaving flat peaks as in a square wave. This adds high frequency overtones which makes the signal fuzzier.

**Soft-clipping**, also known as **saturation**, is where the peaks of the wave are gently compressed. This means there is still a bit of a curve in the peaks. This is common for overdrive.

**Hard-clipping** is more abrupt and flattens out the peaks of the signal. This creates more distortion, as in a fuzz pedal.
Soft clipping creates mostly even harmonics, while hard clipping creates more odd harmonics.

**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)** is the measurement (in percent) of how much harmonic distortion a circuit will generate. It calculates the total of both even and odd harmonics.

## Phase

Waves can have the same frequency and amplitude, yet have a different _phase_. We can think of the phase as the timing of the wave.

Think of an example where we have two identical sine waves. The only difference is, they start at a different time. This leads to the two waves being _out of phase_.

This can get interesting when we talk about audio effects. We have have waves in different phases to create interesting effects. Modifying phase is commonly used in phaser and chorus effects.
