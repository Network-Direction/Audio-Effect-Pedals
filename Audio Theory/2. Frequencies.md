# Frequencies
The frequency of a wave is the total times its wavelength passes a given point in a second. This is measured in hertz (Hz).

We may think of a sound as one single sine wave, but it’s more complex. Even a single note on a single instrument produces multiple vibrations at multiple frequencies. We can think of a waveform as several different sine waves layered on top of each other.

The lowest of these frequencies is called the fundamental frequency. This provides a sound with its strongest audible pitch reference. That is, it’s the dominant frequency in a complex waveform.

A harmonic is a component of a sound that is above the audible fundamental frequency. There are usually a few of these, and they make up the harmonic spectrum of the sound. Each harmonic has a lower amplitude than the fundamental.

A harmonic is a multiple of the fundamental. For example, if the fundamental is 50Hz, the second harmonic will have a frequency of 100Hz. The third will be 150Hz, and so on.

This shows us that harmonics are related to the fundamental frequency of the waveform.

Overtones on the other hand, are also higher in frequency than the fundamental, but do not have any direct relation to the fundamental frequency.

## Timbre
Timbre refers to the tone, colour, or voice of a sound. The same note can be played on many different instruments, and they’ll all sound different.

This note is represented by the fundamental frequency. It’s the presence of harmonics and overtones that make up the timbre of the sound.

Second-order harmonics, also known as even harmonics, are even numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, the second and fourth harmonics are both even harmonics.

Third-order harmonics, known as odd harmonics, are odd numbered multiples of the fundamental frequencies.

Second-order harmonics are complementary to the fundamental frequency, and therefore create a rich, pleasing sound.

Third-order harmonics give a signal an edgier, more aggressive sound. These are commonly present in distortion pedals.
