# Waveforms

Sound waves are vibrations in pressure in the air, or another material, that weâ€™re able to sense with our ears. When something makes a sound, the particles in the air vibrate, which causes our eardrum to vibrate.
As sound waves propagate through a material, the energy dissipates. This is the sound getting quieter as it gets further away from the source. Different materials will affect the energy dissipation in different ways.

True sound waves are longitudinal. However, when we depict them graphically, we use a transverse wave:


This is easier for us to understand visually. However, it is not strictly the way sound waves work.
The representation above is actually a sine wave. It is the simplest of waves.
Sometimes a waveform is called an oscillogram.
