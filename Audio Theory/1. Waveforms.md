# Waveforms
Sound waves are vibrations in pressure in the air, or another material, that we’re able to sense with our ears. When something makes a sound, the particles in the air vibrate, which causes our eardrum to vibrate.

As sound waves propagate through a material, the energy dissipates. This is the sound getting quieter as it gets further away from the source. Different materials will affect the energy dissipation in different ways.

True sound waves are **longitudinal**. However, when we depict them graphically, we use a **transverse **wave:

</br></br>

This is easier for us to understand visually. However, it is not strictly the way sound waves work.

The representation above is actually a sine wave. It is the simplest of waves.

Sometimes a waveform is called an oscillogram.

## Amplitude
Sounds are made up of waves. These waves can be displayed graphically:

</br></br>

In particular here, we’re interested in the amplitude, which is a measure of how strong a wave is.

The simplest way to measure amplitude is zero-to-peak. This measures the maximum positive or negative size of the wave. Peak-to-peak is also mentioned, where we measure the highest point to the lowest point.

The second method is Roor-mean-square (RMS). This is far more useful, as it measures a meaningful average.

## Root Mean Square (RMS)
RMS is a math term used in various areas, such as statistics, machine learning, electronics, and audio. Mathematically, it means we have a set of numbers, square them all, get the mean (average), and then calculate the square root. This is very good for getting averages over time.

</br></br>

So in audio, we can think of RMS as the average loudness of a signal. While zero to peak can measure amplitude at a particular instant (which might be prolonged or might be fleeting), RMS can give us more meaningful information about a sound, in particular the perceived loudness.

Speakers, for example, have an RMS rating measured in watts. This is the maximum amount of power (amplitude) that the speakers can tolerate over a period of time.

## Wave Shapes
As previously noted, a sine wave is the simplest wave. It is a pure tone with a fundamental frequency, but no harmonics or overtones.

A square wave looks like a square (obviously), with instant attack and release (no smooth transition). This means the envelope is also square.

</br></br>

In reality it can’t be a perfect square, as it’s impossible for the attack and release to be truly instantaneous.

The square wave contains odd harmonics, creating a more aggressive sound.


The triangle wave shares similarities to both the sine and square waves. It’s similar to a square wave in that it contains odd harmonics, so it also has a more aggressive sound.

The sawtooth wave contains both odd and even harmonics, and is called the richest in terms of timbre out of the four common shapes.
