# Envelope
The envelope is a property of a sound that shows how the level of a sound wave changes over time. That is, a wave has an envelope.

Just as we can imagine a sound being expressed as a drawing of a wave, we can also express the envelope with a picture:

</br></br>

In this example, we can see that the envelope is showing the overall shape of the sound.

There are four parts in the envelope’s anatomy:
* Attack
* Decay
* Sustain
* Release

We can think of these as a picture too:

## ADSR

The **attack** is the part of the envelope that represents the time it takes for the amplitude of the sound to reach its maximum level. This is the build up of the sound.

**Decay** is the reduction in amplitude over time. This comes immediately after the attack (where the amplitude is at its peak), and decreases to the _sustain_ level.

The **sustain** is not a time parameter like attack and decay. Sustain is a _level_.

In music production, especially noticable with synths, a sound engineer will set the sustain level on a particular sound. The _decay_ is the period of time it takes to reach this level.

The note or sound is held at the _sustain_ level until it is released. Think of playing a chord on a synthesizer keyboard. You hold the chord for as long as you want, which is the _sustain_. Eventually you _release_ the keys on the keyboard.

The **release** is the final fading of the signal. This is a time based parameter, which reflects the time for the sound to die out (the amplitude reducing to zero).

## ADSR Envelope
The ADSR Envelope refers to the tools used in sound equipment to adjust the attack, decay, sustain, and release. These tools _control_ other sounds.

Different instruments will have different envelope types. Drums and other percussion will have a fast attack and release, while stringed instruments may have a slower attack, building up slowly (think of a violin or cello). This builds suspense and anticipation.

Here is an example of strings that have a slow attack (building up to a peak), long sustain, and long decay:

</br></br>


Instruments like drums and other percussion may effectively have zero (or nearly zero) sustain. Guitars and other plucked string instruments are similar in this sense. They appear to go from attack straight to release, as shown in this percussion example:

> [!NOTE]  
> When considering envelopes, we need to think of the amplitude’s RMS values, not peak to peak. A high peak does not necessarily make a sound louder. This requires more sustain.
