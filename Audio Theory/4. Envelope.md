# Envelope
The envelope is a property of a sound that shows how the level of a sound wave changes over time. That is, a wave has an envelope.

Just as we can imagine a sound being expressed as a drawing of a wave, we can also express the envelope with a picture:

</br></br>

In this example, we can see that the envelope is showing the overall shape of the sound.

There are four parts in the envelope’s anatomy:
* Attack
* Decay
* Sustain
* Release

We can think of these as a picture too:

## ADSR

The **attack** is the part of the envelope that represents the time it takes for the amplitude of the sound to reach its maximum level. This is the build up of the sound.

**Decay** is the reduction in amplitude over time. This comes immediately after the attack, where the amplitude is at its peak, and decreases to the _sustain_ level.

The **sustain** is the time period in which the sound is held at a steady level before it begins to fade out.

The **release** is the final fading of the signal, where the amplitude reduces to zero.

## ADSR Envelope
The ADSR Envelope refers to the tools used in sound equipment to adjust the attack, decay, sustain, and release.

Different instruments will have different envelope types. Drums and other percussion will have a fast attack and release, while stringed instruments may have a slower attack, building up slowly (think of a violin or cello).

When considering envelopes, we need to think of the amplitude’s RMS values, not peak to peak. A high peak does not necessarily make a sound louder. This requires more sustain.

Short peaks contribute to the timbre of a sound, not loudness.
