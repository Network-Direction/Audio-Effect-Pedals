# Resonance

Resonance can mean different things in different contexts, from audio to physics (which are definitely related subjects).

## Resonant Frequencies

In audio terms, resonance is a phenomenon where something vibrates at specific frequencies. This 'something' can be a room, an instrument, or some other audio device.

For example, you might be holding an acoustic guitar. If you play a range of different frequencies through some nearby speakers, you might find that your guitar 'reacts' (vibrates) to some of these frequencies. It might even make a faint hum.

These special frequencies are called _resonant frequencies_. Different objects will have different resonant frequencies.

## Frequency Response

If we have a microphone in the room, we can analyse the _frequency response_. The result of this can be displayed as a graph, like this:
