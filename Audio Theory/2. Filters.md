## Overview
A pass filter allows us to filter out parts of the audio spectrum. This is different to EQ’s and other filters, which turn the power of certain frequencies up and down.

A **pass filter** will effectively allow certain frequencies in a signal to pass through, while attenuating others.

These are often used in guitar pedals as tone stacks, where we want to shape the tone, or control the bass, mids, and treble of the sound.

A **high-pass filter (HPF)** will allow frequencies over a certain point through, and will cut frequencies below. A **low-pass filter (LPF)** will allow frequencies below a certain point, and cut higher frequencies.

A **band pass filter**, allows frequencies in a certain range (a band), while attenuating the signal above and below that band. A **band stop filter** is the complete opposite, where a particular band is blocked, while frequencies above and below are passed.


<br/><br/>
## Roll-off and Slope
The main characteristics of these filters are **roll-off** (AKA, cut-off) and **slope**. Pass filters aren’t binary, completely blocking or allowing all frequencies above or below a certain point. Instead, we need to think of it as a non-linear graph.

Above we have a low-pass filter that is allowing all lower frequencies, while attenuating frequencies above about 2KHz. Notice that they aren’t immediately blocked after passing the 2KHz point. Instead, the strength of the frequencies start to roll off or attenuate.

The important part here is that the roll-off point isn’t at 2KHz where the signal starts to attenuate. Instead, the roll-off point is where 3dB of attenuation has been achieved. In this example, the roll-off point is about 4KHz. That makes this a **4KHz LPF**.

The **slope **is how steeply the attenuation occurs. Some equipment allows the slope to be controlled, while others don’t.

The slope is measured in decibels per octave (dB/oct). The more decibels cut per octave, the steeper the slope will be.

![Roll-off-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6be56ae5-ac94-4dbc-a9f3-0fb67896f9bf)


The example above is a more gradual slope than the previous example. Attenuation starts at about 200Hz, with the roll-off at about 1.9KHz.

We can measure the slope by thinking about how fast the output level drops or increases. We might say, for example, that it drops at a rate of 6dB per octave (each octave is 2x frequency). This would be a steeper slope than one that drops at a rate of 3dB per octave.

Another way to express this is by decade (which is a 1x increase in frequency). 6dB per octave would be the same as 20dB per decade. A steeper slope would be 40dB per decade.

## LC Filter Circuits

In a circuit, filters are created with specific combinations of inductors, resistors, and capacitors. This relies on two basic principles:
* Capacitors block DC current, while allowing AC current
* Inductors block AC current, while allowing DC current

Of course, that’s over simplified. Different values of capacitor and inductor are better at blocking or passing specific frequencies. In general, capacitors will pass higher frequencies, while inductors pass lower frequencies (which are closer to a flat DC signal).

These are called passive filters, as they are made from passive components. That is, there are no transistors or op amps to boost the signal (the output level will always be less than the input).

This is a low-pass LC filter:

![LC Filter-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b74bd8b2-4c37-41c3-b2e6-893237f6c2c7)


Higher frequencies are shunted to ground, while lower frequencies are allowed to pass across the inductor. The values of the two components determine the roll-off.

This is a high-pass LC filter:

![LC Filter-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6642f5a4-1770-4ee0-8c38-75fc89f1d57c)


Lower frequencies are shunted to ground, while the higher frequencies are allowed to pass.

A combination of the two can create a band-pass filter:

![LC Filter-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/527bba07-9397-4b71-88c5-ae9e779cb114)


The values of the components are chosen so higher and lower frequencies are shunted to ground through the capacitor and inductor, while frequencies within the band are allowed to pass.

An LC filter tends to add a sharp boost near the roll-off point. This is the filter’s **resonant frequency**.

## RC Filter Circuits
Another way to create these circuits is with resistors and capacitors. These are also passive filters.

This is a simple RC LPF, where higher frequencies are shunted to ground:

![RC Filter-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae11ca82-a414-44a6-896d-661734b9e1ef)


A high-pass filter swaps the resistor and capacitor, to pass the higher frequencies, while shunting the lower ones to ground.


<br/><br/>
## Which to Use?
Low frequency applications, that is up to about 100KHz, are generally made with RC filters. Frequencies above 100KHz are generally made with RLC filters.
The RLC filter is an LC filter with the addition of resistors.


<br/><br/>
## Multi-Stage Filters
When there is only one reactive component in place (eg, one capacitor, as in the RC circuit) it is called a first-order filter or one-pole filter. LC filters are called second-order filters, as they have two reactive components (the inductor and the capacitor).

We can also create multiple stages to increase the number of reactive components:

![Multi-stage-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd8200a-5f50-4d24-8399-8735fb7d710e)


Creating more stages has two effects:
* Creating a steeper slope
* Increasing attenuation

This means we can make n-order filters (where n is the number of stages), to make a pass filter more ‘accurate’. However, the signal will decrease (meaning a gain of less than one), requiring an active component to boost the signal at some point.


<br/><br/>
## Active Filters
The previous examples are passive filters, as they only use passive components. As these attenuate the overall signal, resulting in a gain of less than one, we often need to create active filters to boost the signal further.

This means using active components like a transistor or op amp:

![Active-Filter-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ca5c8c-d1c1-4dbc-abaf-bccc92f79328)


An active filter like this one is also known as a first order filter. This is because it only has a single filtering stage.

It is important to note though, that while a passive filter has an infinite frequency response (in theory, the right combination of components can reach and filter any frequency), an active filter is limited by the bandwidth and feedback network of the op amp. This means an active HPF will have a maximum frequency limit it can filter at.

This means the opamp will have a frequency response curve. We need to select the right op amp, and design the feedback appropriately to get the frequencies we need. This is where we want to use low tolerance resistors and capacitors.

For the most part though, this isn’t much of a problem with analogue audio. Video and other high-frequency applications are another matter.


<br/><br/>
## Second Order Filters
A second order filter, also called a two-pole filter, is made of two RC filter sections that are connected together. While a normal filter would have a rolloff of 6dB per octave (20dB per decade), this can achieve 12dB per octave (40dB per decade).

This means we can use second order filters to create a very steep slope, which in turn means that we can create filters for very specific frequencies.

![Second-Order-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4d791c3-f9b6-402d-8f1b-2154263131b0)

![Second-Order-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27b6b4e-d0f1-4126-bb32-1e205d0fe327)


More stages can be cascaded to get a steeper slope. 3rd order = 60dB per decade, 4th order = 80dB per decade, etc.
