## Overview
A pass filter allows us to filter out parts of the audio spectrum. This is different to EQ’s and other filters, which turn the power of certain frequencies up and down.

A **pass filter** will effectively allow certain frequencies in a signal to pass through, while attenuating others.

These are often used in guitar pedals as tone stacks, where we want to shape the tone, or control the bass, mids, and treble of the sound.

A **high-pass filter (HPF)** will allow frequencies over a certain point through, and will cut frequencies below. A **low-pass filter (LPF)** will allow frequencies below a certain point, and cut higher frequencies.

A **band pass filter**, allows frequencies in a certain range (a band), while attenuating the signal above and below that band. A **band stop filter** is the complete opposite, where a particular band is blocked, while frequencies above and below are passed.

## Roll-off and Slope
The main characteristics of these filters are **roll-off** (AKA, cut-off) and **slope**. Pass filters aren’t binary, completely blocking or allowing all frequencies above or below a certain point. Instead, we need to think of it as a non-linear graph.

Above we have a low-pass filter that is allowing all lower frequencies, while attenuating frequencies above about 2KHz. Notice that they aren’t immediately blocked after passing the 2KHz point. Instead, the strength of the frequencies start to roll off or attenuate.

The important part here is that the roll-off point isn’t at 2KHz where the signal starts to attenuate. Instead, the roll-off point is where 3dB of attenuation has been achieved. In this example, the roll-off point is about 4KHz. That makes this a **4KHz LPF**.

The **slope **is how steeply the attenuation occurs. Some equipment allows the slope to be controlled, while others don’t.

The slope is measured in decibels per octave (dB/oct). The more decibels cut per octave, the steeper the slope will be.

The example above is a more gradual slope than the previous example. Attenuation starts at about 200Hz, with the roll-off at about 1.9KHz.

We can measure the slope by thinking about how fast the output level drops or increases. We might say, for example, that it drops at a rate of 6dB per octave (each octave is 2x frequency). This would be a steeper slope than one that drops at a rate of 3dB per octave.

Another way to express this is by decade (which is a 1x increase in frequency). 6dB per octave would be the same as 20dB per decade. A steeper slope would be 40dB per decade.

## Active Filters
The previous examples are passive filters, as they only use passive components. As these attenuate the overall signal, resulting in a gain of less than one, we often need to create active filters to boost the signal further.

This means using active components like a transistor or op amp:

An active filter like this one is also known as a first order filter. This is because it only has a single filtering stage.

It is important to note though, that while a passive filter has an infinite frequency response (in theory, the right combination of components can reach and filter any frequency), an active filter is limited by the bandwidth and feedback network of the op amp. This means an active HPF will have a maximum frequency limit it can filter at.

This means the opamp will have a frequency response curve. We need to select the right op amp, and design the feedback appropriately to get the frequencies we need. This is where we want to use low tolerance resistors and capacitors.

For the most part though, this isn’t much of a problem with analogue audio. Video and other high-frequency applications are another matter.


<br/><br/>
## Second Order Filters
A second order filter, also called a two-pole filter, is made of two RC filter sections that are connected together. While a normal filter would have a rolloff of 6dB per octave (20dB per decade), this can achieve 12dB per octave (40dB per decade).

This means we can use second order filters to create a very steep slope, which in turn means that we can create filters for very specific frequencies.

![Second-Order-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27b6b4e-d0f1-4126-bb32-1e205d0fe327)


More stages can be cascaded to get a steeper slope. 3rd order = 60dB per decade, 4th order = 80dB per decade, etc.
