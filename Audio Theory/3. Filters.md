# Filters
A filter allows us to target and filter parts of the audio spectrum (different frequencies). Sometimes this is used to remove unwanted frequencies, while other times this can target and boost particular frequencies.

Nearly all effects pedals will have filters in them. Some, such as an equalizer, even focus on the use of filters.

## Filter Types

A **pass filter** will effectively allow certain frequencies in a signal to pass through, while attenuating others. These are often used in guitar pedals as tone stacks, where we want to shape the tone, or control the bass, mids, and treble of the sound. These include:
* High Pass Filter
* Low Pass Filter
* Band Pass Filter

A **high-pass filter (HPF)** will allow frequencies over a certain point through, and will cut frequencies below.

A **low-pass filter (LPF)** will allow frequencies below a certain point, and cut higher frequencies.

A **band pass filter**, allows frequencies in a certain range (a band), while attenuating the signal above and below that band. A **band stop filter** is the complete opposite, where a particular band is blocked, while frequencies above and below are passed.
</br></br>

There are other filters in addition to pass filters.

A **Band stop filter** is the opposite of the band pass filter. Instead of allowing frequencies within a particular band and attenuating frequencies above and below, the band stop filter attenuates frequencies within a band, and passes frequencies above and below.

An **All Pass Filter** is an unusual type of filter. It targets all frequencies in a given signal. The purpose of the all pass filter is not to attenuate or boost certain frequencies, but to adjust the _phase_ of the signal. This is commonly used in modulation effects like **phasers** and **chorus**.

## Roll-off and Slope

The main characteristics of these filters are **roll-off** (AKA, cut-off) and **slope**. Pass filters aren’t binary, completely blocking or allowing all frequencies above or below a certain point. Instead, we need to think of it as a non-linear graph.

Above we have a low-pass filter that is allowing all lower frequencies, while attenuating frequencies above about 2KHz. Notice that they aren’t immediately blocked after passing the 2KHz point. Instead, the strength of the frequencies start to roll off or attenuate.

The important part here is that the roll-off point isn’t at 2KHz where the signal starts to attenuate. Instead, the roll-off point is where 3dB of attenuation has been achieved. In this example, the roll-off point is about 4KHz. That makes this a **4KHz LPF**.

The **slope** is how steeply the attenuation occurs. Some equipment allows the slope to be controlled, while others don’t.

The slope is measured in decibels per octave (dB/oct). The more decibels cut per octave, the steeper the slope will be.

The example above is a more gradual slope than the previous example. Attenuation starts at about 200Hz, with the roll-off at about 1.9KHz.

We can measure the slope by thinking about how fast the output level drops or increases. We might say, for example, that it drops at a rate of 6dB per octave (each octave is 2x frequency). This would be a steeper slope than one that drops at a rate of 3dB per octave.

Another way to express this is by decade (which is a 1x increase in frequency). 6dB per octave would be the same as 20dB per decade. A steeper slope would be 40dB per decade.

## Second Order Filters
A second order filter, also called a two-pole filter, is made of two filter sections that are connected together. While a normal filter would have a rolloff of 6dB per octave (20dB per decade), this can achieve 12dB per octave (40dB per decade).

This means we can use second order filters to create a very steep slope, which in turn means that we can create filters for very specific frequencies.

More stages can be cascaded to get a steeper slope. 3rd order = 60dB per decade, 4th order = 80dB per decade, etc.
