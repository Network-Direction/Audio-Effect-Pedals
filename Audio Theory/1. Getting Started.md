# Getting Started with Audio Theory

## Waveforms
Sound waves are vibrations in pressure in the air, or another material, that we’re able to sense with our ears. When something makes a sound, the particles in the air vibrate, which causes our eardrum to vibrate.

As sound waves propagate through a material, the energy dissipates. This is the sound getting quieter as it gets further away from the source. Different materials will affect the energy dissipation in different ways.

True sound waves are **longitudinal**. However, when we depict them graphically, we use a **transverse **wave:

![Waveform-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab0fde4-830d-43da-ac6f-25af4a674a3b)


This is easier for us to understand visually. However, it is not strictly the way sound waves work.

The representation above is actually a sine wave. It is the simplest of waves.

Sometimes a waveform is called an oscillogram.


<br/><br/>
## Amplitude
Sounds are made up of waves. These waves can be displayed graphically:

![Amplitude-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78849d8a-644e-412b-8b7f-96beaa5639d6)

In particular here, we’re interested in the amplitude, which is a measure of how strong a wave is.

The simplest way to measure amplitude is zero-to-peak. This measures the maximum positive or negative size of the wave. Peak-to-peak is also mentioned, where we measure the highest point to the lowest point.

The second method is Roor-mean-square (RMS). This is far more useful, as it measures a meaningful average.


<br/><br/>
## Root Mean Square (RMS)
RMS is a math term used in various areas, such as statistics, machine learning, electronics, and audio. Mathematically, it means we have a set of numbers, square them all, get the mean (average), and then calculate the square root. This is very good for getting averages over time.

![RMS-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e8e0b8a-331c-4c05-afd9-2ec7d63a4949)


So in audio, we can think of RMS as the average loudness of a signal. While zero to peak can measure amplitude at a particular instant (which might be prolonged or might be fleeting), RMS can give us more meaningful information about a sound, in particular the perceived loudness.

Speakers, for example, have an RMS rating measured in watts. This is the maximum amount of power (amplitude) that the speakers can tolerate over a period of time.

<br/><br/>
## Frequencies
The frequency of a wave is the total times its wavelength passes a given point in a second. This is measured in hertz (Hz).

We may think of a sound as one single sine wave, but it’s more complex. Even a single note on a single instrument produces multiple vibrations at multiple frequencies. We can think of a waveform as several different sine waves layered on top of each other.

The lowest of these frequencies is called the fundamental frequency. This provides a sound with its strongest audible pitch reference. That is, it’s the dominant frequency in a complex waveform.

A harmonic is a component of a sound that is above the audible fundamental frequency. There are usually a few of these, and they make up the harmonic spectrum of the sound. Each harmonic has a lower amplitude than the fundamental.

A harmonic is a multiple of the fundamental. For example, if the fundamental is 50Hz, the second harmonic will have a frequency of 100Hz. The third will be 150Hz, and so on.

![Frequencies-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90234784-9564-42db-9cbd-ad0c97e292c4)


This shows us that harmonics are related to the fundamental frequency of the waveform.

Overtones on the other hand, are also higher in frequency than the fundamental, but do not have any direct relation to the fundamental frequency.


<br/><br/>
## Timbre
Timbre refers to the tone, colour, or voice of a sound. The same note can be played on many different instruments, and they’ll all sound different.

This note is represented by the fundamental frequency. It’s the presence of harmonics and overtones that make up the timbre of the sound.

Second-order harmonics, also known as even harmonics, are even numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, the second and fourth harmonics are both even harmonics.

Third-order harmonics, known as odd harmonics, are odd numbered multiples of the fundamental frequencies.

Second-order harmonics are complementary to the fundamental frequency, and therefore create a rich, pleasing sound.

Third-order harmonics give a signal an edgier, more aggressive sound. These are commonly present in distortion pedals.


<br/><br/>
## Envelope
The envelope is a property of a sound that shows how the level of a sound wave changes over time. That is, a wave has an envelope.

Just as we can imagine a sound being expressed as a drawing of a wave, we can also express the envelope with a picture:

![Envelope-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ae92a55-5e0e-44e3-8714-3face32a68bf)


In this example, we can see that the envelope is showing the overall shape of the sound.

There are four parts in the envelope’s anatomy:
* Attack
* Decay
* Sustain
* Release

We can think of these as a picture too:

![Envelope-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6f0156b-3516-4ce8-9c50-c12f65b106ce)


The attack is the part of the envelope that represents the amplitude of the sound to reach its maximum level. This is the build up of the sound.

Decay is the reduction in amplitude over time. This comes immediately after the attack, where the amplitude is at its peak.

Right after the decay is the sustain. This is the time period in which the sound is held at a steady level before it begins to fade out.

The release is the final fading of the signal, where the amplitude reduces to zero.

The ADSR Envelope refers to the tools used in sound equipment to adjust the attack, decay, sustain, and release.

Different instruments will have different envelope types. Drums and other percussion will have a fast attack and release, while stringed instruments may have a slower attack, building up slowly (think of a violin or cello).

When considering envelopes, we need to think of the amplitude’s RMS values, not peak to peak. A high peak does not necessarily make a sound louder. This requires more sustain.

Short peaks contribute to the timbre of a sound, not loudness.


<br/><br/>
## Wave Shapes
As previously noted, a sine wave is the simplest wave. It is a pure tone with a fundamental frequency, but no harmonics or overtones.

![Wave Shapes -1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b404c6d6-a9a8-4722-980b-100da70b827e)

A square wave looks like a square (obviously), with instant attack and release (no smooth transition). This means the envelope is also square.

![Wave Shapes -2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adf61de3-1bbd-4186-8e06-7dc70a2a11b8)

In reality it can’t be a perfect square, as it’s impossible for the attack and release to be truly instantaneous.

The square wave contains odd harmonics, creating a more aggressive sound.


The triangle wave shares similarities to both the sine and square waves. It’s similar to a square wave in that it contains odd harmonics, so it also has a more aggressive sound.

![Wave Shapes -3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fdecf1e-8f6e-4829-81db-8cdb486f01a7)


The sawtooth wave contains both odd and even harmonics, and is called the richest in terms of timbre out of the four common shapes.

<br/><br/>
## Distortion
Distortion occurs when a change is made to an audio signal. This can be deliberate or accidental. When deliberate, distortion is usually a good thing.

In its simplest definition, distortion includes amplification, compression, and EQ changes. More practically though, we think of distortion as harmonic distortion, which is the result of clipping, saturation, or overdriving, in an audio circuit.

**Clipping** is when the signal is boosted so high that the audio circuit can not accurately reproduce it. The top and bottoms of the waveforms are clipped off, leaving flat peaks as in a square wave. This adds high frequency overtones which makes the signal fuzzier.

**Soft-clipping**, also known as **saturation**, is where the peaks of the wave are gently compressed. This means there is still a bit of a curve in the peaks. This is common for overdrive.

**Hard-clipping** is more abrupt and flattens out the peaks of the signal. This creates more distortion, as in a fuzz pedal.
Soft clipping creates mostly even harmonics, while hard clipping creates more odd harmonics.

![Distortion-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce08ce5-9a27-46ef-9c29-bcbddfa820ef)


**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)** is the measurement (in percent) of how much harmonic distortion a circuit will generate. It calculates the total of both even and odd harmonics.
